The timing and cost of toll payments in the U.S. depend on the type of toll system used on the highway. Here's how it works:  

---

## **1. Ticket-Based Toll System (Pay When You Exit)**

- **How it works:** You take a ticket when entering the toll road and pay when exiting.
- **Payment method:** Cash, credit card (in some places), or an electronic toll pass (like E-ZPass).
- **Where it's used:** The **New York Thruway (I-90)**, **Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90)**, and some **Ohio & Pennsylvania toll roads**.
- **How the toll is calculated:** Based on the **distance traveled** (entry point to exit point).

ðŸ›‘ **Example:** If you enter the highway at **Exit 1** and leave at **Exit 10**, you pay based on the miles driven between those exits.

## **2. Fixed-Rate Toll System (Pay at Each Toll Booth)**

- **How it works:** You pay a set fee at each toll booth you pass.
- **Payment method:** Cash, credit card (in some locations), or an electronic toll pass.
- **Where it's used:** Many older toll roads and bridges, such as the **Chicago Skyway** and **some Florida toll roads**.
- **How the toll is calculated:** You pay each time you pass a toll plaza, regardless of distance.

ðŸ›‘ **Example:** If you drive through **three toll plazas**, you pay three separate fees.

## **3. Electronic/Open-Road Tolling (Pay Automatically or By Plate)**

- **How it works:** No stoppingâ€”tolls are charged electronically as you pass under sensors.
- **Payment method:** **E-ZPass/SunPass/FasTrak transponder** OR cameras capture your license plate and bill you later (**Pay-By-Plate**).
- **Where it's used:** **Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, California, and Illinois toll roads**.
- **How the toll is calculated:** Based on where you enter and exit, or a fixed price at each checkpoint.

ðŸ›‘ **Example:** If you drive on the **Mass Pike (I-90 in Massachusetts)** without an E-ZPass, a bill will be sent to your home in Canada.

## **4. Toll Bridges & Tunnels (Pay Once When Crossing)**

- **How it works:** You pay a toll **only when crossing the bridge/tunnel**.
- **Payment method:** Cash, credit, or electronic toll pass.
- **Where it's used:** **Ambassador Bridge (Detroit-Windsor), Peace Bridge (Buffalo), George Washington Bridge (NYC).**
- **How the toll is calculated:** Flat fee for each crossing.

ðŸ›‘ **Example:** Entering **New York City from New Jersey** (e.g., via the Holland Tunnel) costs a toll, but leaving NYC is free.
