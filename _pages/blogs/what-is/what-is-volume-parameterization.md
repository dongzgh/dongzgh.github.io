**Volume Parameterization**, also called **Volumetric Texture Mapping**. This is the process of defining a mapping from a 3D volume (often an irregular shape) to a parametric space (like a cube or a regular grid), which is essential for applications like texture mapping, simulation, or finite element analysis. I’ll organize the review by major approaches and highlight their pros and cons.

## Direct 3D Coordinate Mapping

* **Idea:** Map the coordinates of the irregular volume directly to a regular parametric domain using simple geometric transforms (translation, scaling, rotation).
* **Example:** Axis-aligned bounding box mapping—map the volume to a unit cube by normalizing coordinates.
* **Pros:**

  * Extremely simple and fast.
  * No complex computation.
* **Cons:**

  * Only works for volumes without complex topology.
  * Can produce large distortions for irregular shapes.
  * Doesn’t preserve local features or angles.

## Harmonic / Laplacian Volumetric Parameterization

* **Idea:** Solve Laplace’s equation (or generalized harmonic functions) in the volume with boundary conditions on the surface mapping to the target parametric space.
* **Formulation:**

  $$
  \Delta \mathbf{u} = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega
  $$

  where $\mathbf{u}=(u,v,w)$ are parametric coordinates, and boundary $\partial \Omega$ is mapped to the target volume boundary.
* **Pros:**

  * Smooth mapping.
  * Preserves global structure reasonably well.
  * Handles complicated topologies if boundary mapping is reasonable.
* **Cons:**

  * Distortion can occur in highly concave or complex geometries.
  * Requires solving PDEs numerically (FEM/FDM).
* **Applications:** Texture mapping in volume rendering, parameterization for finite element meshing.

## Barycentric / Tetrahedral Mesh Parameterization

* **Idea:** Discretize the volume into tetrahedra and define a mapping from each tetrahedron to a parametric domain using barycentric coordinates.
* **Process:**

  * Mesh the volume with tetrahedra.
  * Define a linear mapping inside each tetrahedron.
  * Solve for vertex positions in the parametric space.
* **Pros:**

  * Can handle very irregular volumes.
  * Local linearity ensures no folding within tetrahedra.
* **Cons:**

  * Global smoothness may be lost.
  * Mesh quality strongly affects mapping quality.
* **Applications:** Mesh morphing, volumetric deformation.

## Harmonic / Conformal Tetrahedral Mapping

* **Idea:** Extend 2D conformal mapping ideas to 3D using tetrahedral meshes:

  * Minimize a volumetric distortion energy (often Jacobian-based).
  * Attempt to preserve angles or volume ratios.
* **Pros:**

  * Better feature preservation.
  * Can maintain near-isometry for small regions.
* **Cons:**

  * Computationally expensive.
  * Global injectivity is hard to guarantee.

## Radial / Spherical Parameterization

* **Idea:** Map volumes to spherical or radial coordinates:

  * Useful for star-shaped or convex volumes.
  * Define mapping from a central point radially to the boundary.
* **Pros:**

  * Simple for convex/star-shaped volumes.
  * Natural for spherical textures.
* **Cons:**

  * Fails for volumes with holes or complex topology.
  * Distortion near concavities.

---

## Skeleton / Cage-based Parameterization

* **Idea:** Use a medial axis or skeleton of the volume to guide the mapping:

  * The skeleton acts like a “cage” that deforms to a canonical domain.
* **Pros:**

  * Handles complex topologies.
  * Preserves main geometric features.
* **Cons:**

  * Requires robust skeleton extraction.
  * Can be unstable for very thin structures.

## Grid-based / Voxel Parameterization

* **Idea:** Discretize the volume into a voxel grid and assign parametric coordinates based on voxel positions:

  * Often used in procedural textures or volume rendering.
* **Pros:**

  * Extremely simple and regular.
  * Compatible with GPU implementations.
* **Cons:**

  * Low flexibility for highly irregular shapes.
  * May require high resolution to reduce distortion.

## Notes

* 3D volume parameterization is inherently harder than 2D due to topology and possible holes.
* Choice of method depends on:

  * Topology of the volume (convex, concave, holes, genus).
  * Desired smoothness or distortion constraints.
  * Computational resources.
* Many modern methods combine **harmonic/tetrahedral parameterization** with **energy minimization** to reduce volumetric distortion while maintaining injectivity.
