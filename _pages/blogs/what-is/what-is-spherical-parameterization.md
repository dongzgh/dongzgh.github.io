## Overview

**Spherical Parameterization** refers to the problem of mapping a closed genus-0 surface mesh (topologically equivalent to a sphere) onto the unit sphere $S^2$. This is indeed a classical but still active research topic in geometry processing, computer graphics, and computational geometry. 

Specifically, given a closed, orientable, genus-0 surface $M \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ represented as a triangle mesh with vertices $V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$ and faces $F$ (Genus-0 means $M$ is topologically equivalent to a sphere.), try to find a bijective mapping

$$
\phi : M \;\to\; S^2
$$

* where $S^2 = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^3 : \|x\| = 1 \}$ is the unit sphere

subject to the optional constraints/requirements:

* **Bijectivity**: The map must be one-to-one (no overlaps or folds).
* **Geometric quality**: The map should minimize some notion of distortion:

   * **Angle preservation (conformality)**: Small triangles in $M$ map with minimal angular distortion.
   * **Area preservation**: Surface area ratios are maintained.
   * **Isometry**: Geodesic lengths preserved (not possible exactly, so approximate).
   * Or some **balanced trade-off** between them.
* **Numerical stability**: The method should handle irregular meshes, non-convex shapes, and varying sampling density.

## Methods

### Harmonic Map Methods

* **Idea**: Solve the Laplace equation on the mesh:

  $$
  \Delta \phi = 0, \quad \phi: M \to S^2,
  $$

  where $\phi$ minimizes the Dirichlet energy.
* **Boundary conditions**:
  * Typically, **three non-collinear vertices** are pinned to fixed positions on the sphere (e.g., the north/south poles and an equator point).
  * This removes the nullspace of rigid motions and ensures a unique solution.
* **Pros**: Simple, smooth embedding.
* **Cons**: May introduce area distortion and fold-overs without careful initialization.

### Conformal Methods (Angle-preserving)

* **Idea**: Approximate conformal maps by minimizing angular distortion (e.g., via discrete conformal equivalence, Möbius transformations, or circle patterns).
* **Boundary conditions**:
  * Conformal maps to the sphere are unique only up to **Möbius transformations** (rotations, translations, scalings, inversions on $S^2$).
  * To fix this freedom, either:
    * Three vertices are prescribed, or
    * Orthogonality constraints (e.g., center of mass at origin, alignment of axes) are imposed.
* **Pros**: Preserves angles, useful for texture mapping.
* **Cons**: Often produces large area distortion.

### Area-preserving Methods

* **Idea**: Optimize the map to preserve local surface areas (e.g., by solving an optimal mass transport problem).
* **Boundary conditions**:
  * Area-preserving maps are unique up to **rotations** of the sphere.
  * A fixed orientation is enforced by aligning one or more landmark vertices to specified points.
* **Pros**: Equal-area mapping, good for visualization of distributions.
* **Cons**: Distorts angles heavily.

### Eigenfunction-based Methods (Spherical Embedding via Laplacian Eigenfunctions)

* **Idea**: Compute the first nontrivial eigenfunctions of the generalized eigenproblem:

  $$
  L f = \lambda M f.
  $$

  The three eigenfunctions $f_1, f_2, f_3$ give coordinates on the sphere (after normalization).
* **Boundary conditions**:
  * No explicit vertex pinning required.
  * Instead, eigenvectors are constrained by **orthogonality under the $M$-inner product**:

    $$
    f_i^T M f_j = \delta_{ij}.
    $$
  * To eliminate the constant eigenfunction, start from $\lambda_1$.
* **Pros**: Natural, global, robust.
* **Cons**: Sensitive to numerical multiplicity of eigenvalues, needs orthogonalization.

### Optimization-based Methods (Energy Minimization)

* **Idea**: Define a distortion energy (conformal, area, or symmetric Dirichlet) and solve:

  $$
  \phi^* = \arg\min_{\phi : M \to S^2} E(\phi).
  $$

* **Boundary conditions**:
  * Typically enforced through **constraints** such as:
    * Fixing a few vertices on the sphere, or
    * Constraining the centroid to lie at the origin, with unit sphere normalization.
* **Pros**: Flexible, can trade off between angle and area preservation.
* **Cons**: Nonlinear, requires iterative solvers, risk of local minima.

### Iterative Stretch Minimization

* **Idea**: Iteratively relax the mesh on the sphere to minimize metric distortion.
* **Boundary conditions**:
  * Start with an initial embedding (usually projection to sphere).
  * Impose centroid at origin and normalization $\|\phi(v)\| = 1$ for all vertices.
  * Orientation fixed by pinning 3 vertices.
* **Pros**: Conceptually simple.
* **Cons**: Convergence slow, sensitive to initialization.
