## Overview

A tetrahedral mesh divides a 3D volume into tetrahedra (4-node elements). Tetrahedra are flexible and can fit almost any shape, which makes Tet meshing popular for:

* CFD in complex geometries
* Structural FEA where automatic meshing is needed
* Medical or biological models with highly irregular shapes

The key challenge is **producing high-quality tetrahedra** (avoiding slivers or highly skewed elements) while covering the volume efficiently.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: surface mesh or CAD geometry.
2. **Point distribution**: place vertices on surface and inside volume.
3. **Tetrahedralization**: create tetrahedra using Delaunay, Advancing Front, or Octree.
4. **Refinement and smoothing**: improve element quality.
5. **Output**: volume mesh ready for FEA/CFD.

## Algorithms

There are three major classes of Tet meshing algorithms:

| **Aspect**               | **Delaunay-based**                                                                                                | **Advancing Front**                                                                            | **Octree-based**                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Principle**            | Inserts points and builds tetrahedra so no point lies inside any tetrahedron’s circumsphere (Delaunay criterion). | Grows mesh from boundary surfaces inward, adding tetrahedra layer by layer.                    | Recursively subdivides the domain into cubes (octants), then splits cubes into tetrahedra. |
| **Mesh Quality**         | Generally good; maximizes minimum angles, but may produce slivers.                                                | High-quality elements near boundaries, good control of grading.                                | Lower quality, more slivers unless smoothed/refined.                                       |
| **Geometry Handling**    | Robust for arbitrary geometries, handles concavities.                                                             | Can struggle with very complex or concave geometries if fronts collide.                        | Handles complex shapes but may need extra refinement near boundaries.                      |
| **Adaptivity**           | Can adaptively refine via point insertion.                                                                        | Good at controlling element size transitions.                                                  | Easy size control by subdividing cubes.                                                    |
| **Automation**           | Fully automatic once input points are given.                                                                      | More manual setup; may require guidance for complex geometries.                                | Fully automatic, fast.                                                                     |
| **Speed**                | Moderate (depends on point insertion and flipping).                                                               | Slower due to iterative front propagation.                                                     | Very fast due to grid-based nature.                                                        |
| **Typical Applications** | General-purpose meshing (CAD, CFD, FEA).                                                                          | High-quality meshes where boundary accuracy is critical (CFD near walls, structural analysis). | Rapid prototyping, voxel-based geometries, medical imaging, implicit modeling.             |
| **Strengths**            | Robust, widely used, mathematically sound.                                                                        | High element quality, excellent boundary control.                                              | Simple, fast, scalable to large domains.                                                   |
| **Weaknesses**           | Sliver tetrahedra may remain.                                                                                     | Can fail on highly concave domains, slower.                                                    | Element quality often poor, requires smoothing.

## Quality

For Tet meshes, quality is critical for simulation accuracy and convergence:

* **Aspect ratio**: ratio of longest edge to shortest height; should be close to 1.
* **Dihedral angles**: avoid very small (<5°) or very large (>170°) angles.
* **Slivers**: tetrahedra with nearly zero volume; highly undesirable.
* **Jacobian**: determinant near zero indicates degenerate elements.

Quality improvement techniques:

* Node smoothing: reposition nodes to optimize angles.
* Edge flipping: replace poor-quality tetrahedra.
* Refinement or coarsening: adapt element size to geometry and simulation needs.

### Delaunay-based Method

A **Delaunay tetrahedralization** of a set of points in 3D is a tetrahedral mesh where **no point lies inside the circumsphere of any tetrahedron**. This maximizes the minimum dihedral angle, which helps avoid sliver tetrahedra.

#### **Algorithm**

The most common approach is **incremental point insertion

   1. Input geometry
      * Start with a 3D volume or a surface mesh.
      * Sample points on the surfaces and optionally inside the volume.
   2. Initialize mesh
      * Create a “super-tetrahedron” that contains all points.
      * This ensures that all subsequent points lie inside an initial tetrahedral mesh.
   3. Insert points incrementally (for each point $P_i$:)
      * Locate containing tetrahedron that encloses $P_i$.
      * Split tetrahedron into smaller tetrahedra with $P_i$ as a vertex.
      * Retriangulate affected region to maintain the Delaunay property (no point inside the circumsphere).
   4. Apply boundary constraints
      * Ensure that surface triangles are preserved.
      * Constrain tetrahedra to match the input geometry.
   5. Refinement and smoothing
      * Edge flipping
      * Node repositioning (smoothing)
      * Local subdivision for refinement
   6. Remove super-tetrahedron
      * Delete tetrahedra that involve vertices of the initial super-tetrahedron.
   7. Output
      * A Delaunay tetrahedral mesh that fills the volume and respects surface geometry.

#### **Example**

```python
# Assume points is a list of 3D coordinates
initialize_super_tetrahedron(points)
tetrahedra = [super_tetrahedron]

for P in points:
    containing_tet = find_containing_tetrahedron(P, tetrahedra)
    new_tets = split_tetrahedron(containing_tet, P)
    tetrahedra.remove(containing_tet)
    tetrahedra.extend(new_tets)
    # Delaunay flipping to maintain empty circumsphere property
    tetrahedra = delaunay_flip(tetrahedra)

remove_super_tetrahedron_vertices(tetrahedra)
return tetrahedra
```
